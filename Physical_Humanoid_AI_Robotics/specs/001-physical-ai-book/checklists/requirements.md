# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [specs/001-physical-ai-book/spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/sp.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Specification focuses on user value rather than implementation
- [x] CHK002 Focused on user value and business needs - All requirements centered on user learning experience
- [x] CHK003 Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible to educational stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements clearly defined
- [x] CHK006 Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each functional requirement has clear criteria
- [x] CHK007 Success criteria are measurable - All success criteria include specific metrics
- [x] CHK008 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Criteria focus on outcomes, not technologies
- [x] CHK009 All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story includes clear acceptance scenarios
- [x] CHK010 Edge cases are identified - Hardware limitations and user experience variations addressed
- [x] CHK011 Scope is clearly bounded - 4-module, 13-week course structure clearly defined
- [x] CHK012 Dependencies and assumptions identified - Hardware requirements and technology stack specified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each requirement is specific and testable
- [x] CHK014 User scenarios cover primary flows - All major user journeys addressed from content access to personalization
- [x] CHK015 Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - All outcomes include specific metrics
- [x] CHK016 No implementation details leak into specification - Focus remains on what users need, not how to build it

## Notes

- All validation items have been completed successfully
- Specification is ready for planning phase
