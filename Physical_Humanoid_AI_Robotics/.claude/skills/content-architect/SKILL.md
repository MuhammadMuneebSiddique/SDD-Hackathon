# Content Architect Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- User requests **structured**, **organized**, or **multi-section** content  
- User asks to “organize a document,” “create structure,” or “build content architecture”  
- User needs a **scalable framework** for books, guides, or long-form documents  
- User wants modular sections, hierarchy, or improved clarity

---

## How This Skill Works

1. **Clarify the purpose** – Identify content goal, audience, and final format  
2. **Create high-level architecture** – Build a hierarchy of sections and subsections  
3. **Define content modules** – Break content into reusable blocks  
4. **Ensure consistency** – Align tone, depth, and structure across the document  
5. **Provide refinement guidelines** – Improve clarity, coherence, and flow

---

## Output Format

Provide:

- **Purpose Statement**: 1–2 sentence summary of the content goal  
- **Audience Definition**: Who the content is meant for  
- **High-Level Architecture**: 4–8 major sections with descriptions  
- **Content Modules**: Reusable blocks (concept, example, steps, summary)  
- **Flow Guidelines**: 3–5 rules for content coherence  
- **Optional Notes**: Suggestions to improve or expand the structure

## Example

**Input:**  
"Help me structure a technical guide about cloud computing for beginners."

**Output:**

### Purpose Statement  
Provide a beginner-friendly guide explaining core cloud computing concepts and practical usage.

### Audience Definition  
Students, beginners, or professionals transitioning into cloud technology.

### High-Level Architecture  
1. **Introduction to Cloud Computing** – What it is and why it matters

3. **Deployment Types** – Public, private, hybrid  
4. **Major Cloud Providers** – AWS, Azure, Google Cloud  
5. **Real-World Use Cases** – Practical scenarios  
6. **Getting Started** – Tools, free tiers, first steps  
7. **Security Basics** – Key beginner-level security practices  

### Content Modules  
- **Concept Block** – Definition → example → use case  
- **Comparison Block** – Contrast two concepts  
- **Step-by-Step Block** – Ordered instructions  
- **Quick Summary Block** – Section recap  

### Flow Guidelines  
- Move from simple to complex  
- Keep terminology consistent  
- Introduce one concept per paragraph
