# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the 13-week capstone course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This comprehensive course will guide you through the essential technologies and concepts needed to build and operate advanced humanoid robotic systems.

## Course Overview

This course is structured around four core modules that build upon each other to create a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System** - Learn the foundational communication layer for robotic applications
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)** - Master simulation and virtual environment creation
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac - The AI-Robot Brain** - Explore AI-powered robotics with NVIDIA's platform
4. **Module 4: VLA - Vision-Language-Action** - Integrate perception, language, and action for intelligent robots

The course culminates in a capstone project where you'll build an autonomous humanoid robot capable of taking voice commands, planning navigation, identifying objects, and manipulating them.

## Learning Approach

This course uses a hands-on, project-based learning approach. Each module includes:
- Theoretical concepts and principles
- Practical implementation exercises
- Lab activities with step-by-step instructions
- Checklists to verify your progress
- Assessments to test your understanding

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Computer science and engineering students
- Robotics researchers and practitioners
- AI and machine learning engineers
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and robotics

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (preferably in Python)
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
