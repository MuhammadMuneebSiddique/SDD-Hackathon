# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers digital twin technology using Gazebo and Unity for physics simulation and environment modeling.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand physics simulation principles (collisions, gravity, dynamics)
- Build simulation environments with sensors (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)
- Use Unity for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) visualization
- Create realistic digital twins for robotic testing

## Module Overview

Digital twin technology allows us to create accurate virtual replicas of physical systems. This module explores how Gazebo and Unity can be used together to create comprehensive simulation environments for humanoid robots.

## Topics Covered

1. [Physics Simulation, Collisions, and Gravity](./physics-simulation)
2. [Environment Building with Sensors](./environment-building)
3. [Unity for HRI Visualization](./hri-visualization)

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic physics concepts
- Basic knowledge of 3D environments
- Module 1 (ROS 2) concepts

## Lab Activities

This module includes hands-on labs where you'll create simulation environments, integrate sensors, and visualize robot interactions in Unity.
