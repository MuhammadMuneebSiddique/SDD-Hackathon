# Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Implement ROS 2 Python (rclpy) bridge for AI agents
- Work with URDF basics for humanoid robots

## Module Overview

ROS 2 provides the foundational communication layer for all robotic systems. In this module, we'll explore how ROS 2 enables distributed computing for robotics, with a focus on applications for humanoid robots and AI integration.

## Topics Covered

1. [Nodes, Topics, and Services](./nodes-topics-services)
2. [ROS 2 Python (rclpy) Bridge for AI Agents](./rclpy-bridge)
3. [URDF Basics for Humanoids](./urdf-basics)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts

## Lab Activities

This module includes hands-on labs where you'll create ROS 2 nodes, implement communication patterns, and integrate with AI agents.
