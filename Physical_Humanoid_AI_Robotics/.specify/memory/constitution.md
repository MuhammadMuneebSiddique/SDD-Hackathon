# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI/Spec-Driven Docusaurus Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Content Generation Through Spec-Kit + Claude Workflows
Content must be generated through Spec-Kit + Claude workflows. High technical accuracy (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac). Clear, educational writing for CS/AI students. Consistent terminology, structure, and style across all pages. Tutorials must be fully reproducible on Ubuntu 22.04.

### Technical Standards and Documentation
Each chapter must include: Overview, Concepts, Steps, Labs, Checklist. First-time definitions for all technical terms. Code in proper fenced blocks (Python, Bash, URDF). Sources: Official docs preferred; IEEE-style citations for major claims.

### Technical Constraints and Deployment
Entire output must be a Docusaurus site (Markdown/MDX). Deployable to GitHub Pages. All diagrams must be Markdown/Mermaid. Minimum scope: ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, Isaac, VLA, Humanoid Control, Capstone.

### Quality Assurance and Verification
Technically correct and verified against primary sources. Style-consistent with this constitution. Builds without errors using `npm run build`. Tutorials reproducible and clear. All modules fully covered and agent-approved.

### Success Criteria
Success criteria include: technically correct and verified content, style consistency, successful builds with `npm run build`, reproducible tutorials, and comprehensive module coverage.

### Development Process
All development must follow Spec-Kit Plus methodology with Claude Code for content generation, planning, and task management.

## Core Principles
The core principles outlined above define the foundational requirements for the project.

## Standards
The standards section covers chapter structure, code formatting, citation requirements, and technical accuracy.

## Governance
All development must follow the specified constraints and meet the success criteria. Compliance with this constitution is mandatory for all project contributions.
